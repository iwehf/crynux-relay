# Quality of Service (QoS) Implementation

This document describes the QoS implementation in the Crynux Relay codebase.

## Overview

The QoS (Quality of Service) system is designed to improve network service quality by rewarding nodes that deliver faster execution and reliable availability, while reducing the impact of nodes that frequently fail or time out.

The QoS score is updated continuously as a node executes tasks and is used as an input to network decisions such as task allocation preference and reliability protection mechanisms.

At its core, QoS is intentionally split across two time scales: a long-term performance component derived from task completion speed (`Q_long`), and a short-term reliability component (`H`) that reacts quickly to timeouts but can recover after sustained success.

## Naming Clarification (Code vs Concepts)

In the codebase, "QoS" may refer to either the persisted long-term performance score or the final runtime QoS used for selection. The mapping below is the source of truth:

| Code Symbol | Actual Meaning |
|-------------|----------------|
| `models.Node.QOSScore` | `Q_long`, the persisted long-term performance score (not the final runtime QoS) |
| `CalculateQosScore(qosScore, healthBase, healthUpdatedAt)` parameter `qosScore` | `Q_long` loaded from `models.Node.QOSScore` |
| `CalculateQosScore(...)` return value | final runtime QoS used for selection |

In short: the database field named `QOSScore` stores long-term performance only, while the final runtime QoS is computed by combining normalized `Q_long` with effective health `H`.

## QoS Score Definition

The final runtime QoS score evaluates node quality through two factors that operate at different time scales:

- **Long-term performance factor**: A rolling average of recent validation task scores that captures whether a node is consistently fast.
- **Short-term reliability factor**: A multiplier that reacts immediately to timeout failures, capturing whether a node is currently dependable.

The final QoS score for a node is the product of both factors:

```
QoS = (Q_long / Q_max) * H
```

Where:
- `Q_long`: the node's long-term performance score (rolling average of task scores).
- `Q_max`: the maximum possible task score (10.0).
- `H`: the short-term reliability factor (range 0 to 1).

If `Q_long` is 0 (e.g., for a new node), it defaults to `5.0` (half of `Q_max`) before applying `H`.

## Factor Calculation

This section explains how `Q_long` and `H` are computed.
### Long-term Performance Score (`Q_long`)

`Q_long` measures a node's sustained execution speed across its recent validation tasks. It changes gradually and reflects the node's typical hardware and network quality.

#### Task Grouping (Validation Tasks)

Not all tasks contribute to `Q_long`. Only **grouped tasks** (validation tasks) receive Task Scores that enter the rolling pool. A grouped task is executed by **3 different nodes** simultaneously. Single (non-grouped) tasks do not generate Task Scores for `Q_long` (though they do influence the short-term reliability factor via successful completion or timeout).

#### Task Score

When a grouped task is validated, each of the 3 tasks in the group receives a **Task Score** based on execution speed (SubmissionTime - StartTime).

Tasks within a group are sorted by execution time (fastest first). The fixed score values are:

| Completion Order | Task Score |
|-----------------|------------|
| 1st (fastest)   | 10         |
| 2nd             | 5          |
| 3rd (slowest)   | 2          |

Special cases:
- A task in a validation group that reached `TaskEndAborted` before group validation receives a score of **0**.
- A validation-group task aborted due to `TaskAbortTimeout` MUST contribute that **0** score to the selected node's rolling long-term QoS average when the same group contains at least one non-aborted task.
- If **all 3 tasks** in a group are aborted, QoS scores are set to NULL (not valid) and are **not included** in any node's rolling average.

#### Rolling Pool Mechanism

The long-term score (`Q_long`) is calculated using an in-memory rolling pool:

- **Pool size**: Configurable via `qos.score_pool_size` (default: 50 tasks)
- The pool is stored per node address in a concurrent-safe map (`NodeQosScorePool`).
- When a new task score arrives, it is appended to the pool. If the pool exceeds the configured size, the oldest entry is removed.
- `Q_long` is the **arithmetic mean** of all scores in the pool.

When a node's pool does not yet exist in memory (e.g., after a relay restart), the pool is initialized from persisted `QOSScore` in the database (`models.Node.QOSScore`, which stores `Q_long`) to ensure smooth transition.

### Short-term Reliability Factor (`H`)

The short-term factor (`H`) addresses the need to immediately penalize nodes that start timing out, protecting applications from unreliable nodes.

Each node carries a **health multiplier** `H` (range 0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0).

#### Penalty on Timeout

When a task assigned to the node ends with a timeout, the health multiplier is penalized by a two-stage rule based on current effective health:

```
if H_effective >= FirstTimeoutHealthThreshold:
    H_new = H_effective * FirstTimeoutPenaltyFactor
else:
    H_new = H_effective * PenaltyFactor
```

With default config values:
- `FirstTimeoutPenaltyFactor = 0.95`
- `FirstTimeoutHealthThreshold = 0.99`
- `PenaltyFactor = 0.3` (heavy penalty for repeated timeout state)

Default behavior example:
- 1 timeout from full health: `1.00 -> 0.95` (light penalty)
- 2nd consecutive timeout: `0.95 -> 0.285` (heavy penalty begins)

#### Health-Based Kickout

When a node's effective health drops below the **health kickout threshold** (`0.1`), the relay MUST kick the node out when the current task finishes. The node leaves the candidate set because its status becomes `Quit`, not because runtime QoS is clamped to zero. Under default penalty settings, this occurs after the heavy-penalty stage drives health below the threshold.

#### Recovery

The penalty is temporary. Health recovers via two mechanisms:

1. **Passive time-based recovery**: Exponential decay toward 1.0 with a 30-minute time constant.
   ```
   H(t) = H_base + (1 - H_base) * (1 - exp(-elapsed / 30min))
   ```
2. **Active success-based recovery**: Every successfully completed task adds a boost of `0.15` to H.
