# Task Validation and Node Slashing

This document describes the task validation and node slashing implementation in the Crynux Relay codebase.

## Overview

The relay implements a Verifiable Secret Sampling (VSS) consensus protocol to ensure that nodes honestly execute AI tasks. A small percentage of tasks are randomly selected for validation, where the same task is sent to 3 independent nodes and their results are cross-compared. Nodes that submit incorrect results are slashed: their staked tokens are confiscated via a blockchain smart contract call.

The design relies on three cryptographic building blocks:

- **Task ID Commitment**: hides the real task identity until validation time, preventing nodes from knowing whether their task is part of a validation group.
- **VRF (Verifiable Random Function)**: determines, in a publicly verifiable but initially secret way, whether a task will be validated.
- **Perceptual hashing / SHA-256**: provides the similarity metric used to compare results across nodes.

## Task ID Commitment Scheme

When a client creates a task, it does not reveal the real `TaskID`. Instead it provides:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `TaskIDCommitment` | `Keccak256(TaskID \|\| Nonce)` |
| `Nonce` | A random value chosen by the creator |

The real `TaskID` stays hidden until the creator calls the validation endpoint. At that point the relay verifies:

```
Keccak256(TaskID || Nonce) == TaskIDCommitment
```

This ensures that nodes cannot tell whether two concurrent tasks share the same `TaskID` (and therefore belong to the same validation group) until validation is explicitly triggered.

## VRF-Based Task Sampling

### Sampling Seed Generation

When a task is created via the `CreateTask` API, the relay generates a cryptographically random 32-byte `SamplingSeed` and stores it alongside the task. This seed is returned to the client and later used as the VRF input.

### Validation Decision

At validation time, the task creator provides a VRF proof computed over the `SamplingSeed` using their private key. The relay:

1. Parses the creator's public key and verifies that the corresponding Ethereum address matches the task creator.
2. Calls `ecvrf.Secp256k1Sha256Tai.Verify` to validate the VRF proof and obtain the VRF output (`beta`).
3. Determines whether the task is selected for validation:

```
needValidation = (beta mod 100) == 0
```

This gives a **1% sampling rate**: roughly 1 in 100 tasks is selected for cross-validation.

### Single vs Grouped Tasks

| Scenario | Task Count | VRF Result | Validation Type |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Not selected | 1 | `beta mod 100 != 0` | Single task validation |
| Selected | 3 | `beta mod 100 == 0` | Group validation (cross-comparison) |

## Task Lifecycle

The full state machine for an inference task:

```
TaskQueued
  → TaskStarted              (node selected, task dispatched)
    → TaskScoreReady          (node submitted result hash)
    → TaskErrorReported       (node reported execution error)
  → TaskEndAborted            (timeout before node selection)

TaskScoreReady / TaskErrorReported
  → TaskValidated             (single task, VRF confirms no validation needed)
  → TaskGroupValidated        (group task, result matches majority)
  → TaskEndInvalidated        (group task, result does not match majority → SLASH)
  → TaskEndGroupRefund        (group task, result matches but task fee refunded)
  → TaskEndAborted            (group task, no majority found)

TaskValidated / TaskGroupValidated
  → TaskEndSuccess            (single task, result uploaded to client)
  → TaskEndGroupSuccess       (group task, result uploaded to client)
```

### Key Timestamps

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `CreateTime` | Task creation time |
| `StartTime` | Node began execution |
| `ScoreReadyTime` | Node submitted the result score/hash |
| `ValidatedTime` | Relay completed validation |
| `ResultUploadedTime` | Result file delivered to client |

## Score Submission

After executing a task, the node submits a **score** (result fingerprint) rather than the full result:

- **SD / SD Fine-tune LoRA tasks**: The score is a perceptual hash (pHash) of the generated image(s). Each pHash is an 8-byte block; multiple images produce concatenated blocks.
- **LLM tasks**: The score is the SHA-256 hash of the full text response.

The score is submitted via the `SubmitScore` API, which transitions the task to `TaskScoreReady`.

## Validation Logic

### Single Task Validation (`ValidateSingleTask`)

For tasks where the VRF confirms no validation is needed (single task):

1. Verify the `TaskID` against the stored `TaskIDCommitment`.
2. Verify the VRF proof to confirm the task was correctly classified as non-grouped.
3. If the task status is `TaskScoreReady` → transition to `TaskValidated`.
4. If the task status is `TaskErrorReported` → abort with reason `TaskAbortIncorrectResult`.

### Group Task Validation (`ValidateTaskGroup`)

For tasks selected for validation (group of 3 tasks sharing the same real `TaskID`):

1. Verify all 3 `TaskIDCommitment` values against the revealed `TaskID`.
2. Verify the VRF proof to confirm the task was correctly classified as grouped.
3. Sort tasks by execution time (fastest first) and assign QoS scores: 1st = 10, 2nd = 5, 3rd = 2. Aborted tasks receive 0.
4. Compare results pairwise to determine the majority.

### Result Comparison

The comparison method depends on task type:

| Task Type | Method | Match Condition |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| SD / SD Fine-tune LoRA | Hamming distance on pHash blocks | Distance < `DistanceThreshold` for every 8-byte block |
| LLM | Exact string comparison | Score strings are identical |

The `DistanceThreshold` is configured via `task.distance_threshold` in the application config.

### Group Validation Outcomes

Given 3 finished tasks (A, B, C), the relay compares all pairs and assigns terminal states:

| Matching Pattern | A | B | C |
|-----------------|---|---|---|
| All 3 match (A=B, A=C, B=C) | `GroupValidated` | `GroupRefund` | `GroupRefund` |
| A=B only (C differs) | `GroupValidated` | `GroupRefund` | **`EndInvalidated`** |
| A=C only (B differs) | `GroupValidated` | **`EndInvalidated`** | `GroupRefund` |
| B=C only (A differs) | **`EndInvalidated`** | `GroupValidated` | `GroupRefund` |
| None match | `EndAborted` | `EndAborted` | `EndAborted` |
| All 3 aborted before scoring | QoS scores set to NULL, no validation | | |

When only 2 of 3 tasks finished (the third was aborted before scoring):
- If the 2 finished tasks match → first gets `GroupValidated`, second gets `GroupRefund`
- If they do not match → both get `EndAborted`

A task reaching `EndInvalidated` triggers the **node slash** for its assigned node.

### Payment Distribution in Groups

When a validation group completes, the task fee is distributed among validated nodes proportionally to their QoS scores:

```
payment_i = task_fee_i * qos_score_i / total_qos_score
```

Where `total_qos_score` is the sum of QoS scores across all valid tasks in the group. Remainder from integer division is added to the last valid task's payment.

Tasks in `GroupRefund` status have their task fee refunded to the creator since the task was a duplicate used purely for validation.

## Node Slashing

### When Slashing Occurs

A node is slashed when its submitted result does not match the majority in a validation group. Specifically, the task transitions to `TaskEndInvalidated`, which calls `nodeSlash`.

### Slash Execution Flow

1. **Node status** is set to `NodeStatusQuit`.
2. **All cached models** associated with the node are deleted from the database.
3. A **`NodeStaking::slashStaking`** blockchain transaction is queued. This calls the `slashStaking` method on the NodeStaking smart contract, which confiscates the node's entire staked balance.
4. Two events are emitted: `NodeSlashed` (with the offending task ID commitment) and `NodeQuit` (with the blockchain transaction ID).

### Normal Quit vs Slashed Quit

| Scenario | Smart Contract Call | Token Outcome |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Normal quit | `NodeStaking::unstake` | Tokens returned to node |
| Slashed quit | `NodeStaking::slashStaking` | Tokens confiscated |

Both paths are handled by `SetNodeStatusQuit`, differentiated by the `slashed` boolean parameter.

## Task Timeout and Abort

Tasks can be aborted for several reasons:

| Abort Reason | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `TaskAbortTimeout` | Task exceeded its deadline (creation time + 3 minutes + configured timeout) |
| `TaskAbortModelDownloadFailed` | Model download failed on the node |
| `TaskAbortIncorrectResult` | Result failed validation |
| `TaskAbortTaskFeeTooLow` | Task fee was too low to attract eligible nodes |

`TaskAbortTaskFeeTooLow` is not assigned by any automatic relay task processing path in current implementation. It appears only when a caller explicitly submits `POST /v1/inference_tasks/:task_id_commitment/abort_reason` with `abort_reason = TaskAbortTaskFeeTooLow`.

When a task is aborted:
- The task fee is refunded to the creator.
- If the abort reason is `TaskAbortTimeout` and the node never submitted a score, a **health penalty** is applied to the node's short-term reliability factor (see QoS documentation).

## Error Reporting

Nodes can report execution errors (e.g., invalid task parameters) via the `ReportTaskError` API. This transitions the task to `TaskErrorReported`. During group validation, if one node reports an error while the other two submit matching results, the error-reporting node is treated as having submitted an incorrect result and is invalidated (slashed).
