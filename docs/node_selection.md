# Node Selection

This document describes how node selection works in Crynux Relay.

## Overview

Node selection is a pipeline:

1. **Hard Filters** build the candidate set.
2. **Base Weight** computes a base weight per candidate from staking and QoS.
3. **Model Locality Boost** boosts weights based on on-disk and in-memory locality.
4. **Weighted Sampling** selects the final node using the effective weights.

## Hard Filters

The relay first applies hard filters to form the candidate set.

- **Availability**. Only nodes currently in the `Available` status are eligible for selection.
- **Hardware compatibility**. If the task specifies a required GPU, the node must match both that GPU model and the required VRAM exactly. Otherwise, the node must satisfy the task's minimum VRAM requirement.
- **Version compatibility**. For task and node version compatibility rules used by this selection flow, see [task_version.md](./task_version.md).
- **Task-specific exclusions**. `LLM` tasks exclude nodes on `Darwin`.
- **Local model filter (on-disk)**. Only select nodes that have at least one required model available locally on disk. If no node has any required model available locally, keep all candidates.

## Base Weight

Base weight is computed from a staking score and a QoS score, then combined using a harmonic mean.

### Staking Score

```
StakingScore = sqrt(staking / maxStaking)
```

Where:
- `staking`: the node's staked amount.
- `maxStaking`: the maximum staked amount among all nodes in the network.

### QoS Score

QoS is computed as described in [qos.md](./qos.md).

### Harmonic Mean

```
BaseWeight = StakingScore * QoS / (StakingScore + QoS)
```

If either `StakingScore` or `QoS` is `0`, then `BaseWeight` is `0`.

## Model Locality Boost

The goal of the model locality boost is to prefer nodes that can start the task sooner and with less network and IO overhead. There are two locality layers. On disk locality means the required model is already downloaded and present on the node. In memory locality means the required model is already loaded and in use in GPU memory. On disk locality is weighted higher because avoiding model downloads typically saves far more time and bandwidth than avoiding an extra load step. In memory locality is still valuable, so it adds an extra bonus on top of on disk locality.

```
boost = 1 + diskWeight * (localCnt / total) + memWeight * (inUseCnt / total)
```

In this formula,

 * `diskWeight` is `0.7` and `memWeight` is `0.3`.
 * `localCnt` is the number of required models that are available locally on disk on the node.
 * `inUseCnt` is the number of required models that are already in GPU memory and in use.
 * `total` is the number of required models for the task.

For a task that requires 3 models, the following cases illustrate how on disk and in memory differ.

| In-memory models | On-disk models | boost |
|--:|--:|--:|
| 0 | 1 | 1.233333 |
| 1 | 1 | 1.333333 |
| 0 | 2 | 1.466667 |
| 1 | 2 | 1.566667 |
| 2 | 2 | 1.666667 |
| 0 | 3 | 1.700000 |
| 1 | 3 | 1.800000 |
| 2 | 3 | 1.900000 |
| 3 | 3 | 2.000000 |

For a task that requires 2 models, the per model contribution is larger because `total` is smaller.

| In-memory models | On-disk models | boost |
|--:|--:|--:|
| 0 | 1 | 1.350000 |
| 1 | 1 | 1.500000 |
| 0 | 2 | 1.700000 |
| 1 | 2 | 1.850000 |
| 2 | 2 | 2.000000 |

For a task that requires 1 model, the locality impact is the strongest.

| In-memory models | On-disk models | boost |
|--:|--:|--:|
| 0 | 1 | 1.700000 |
| 1 | 1 | 2.000000 |

## Final Effective Weight

```
EffectiveWeight = BaseWeight * boost
```

## Weighted Sampling

Nodes are sampled by weighted random selection using `EffectiveWeight`.
